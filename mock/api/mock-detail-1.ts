      "The candidate did not implement any solution within the delete Duplicates` function, indicating a lack of understanding or inability to apply algorithms to solve the problem of removing duplicates from a linked list. This shows a significant gap in both knowledge and application of algorithms and data structures, specifically linked lists.",

    score: 4,
    suggestion:
      "The candidate provided a template for the solution but did not write any functional code within the `deleteDuplicatesâ€™ function. This indicates alack of ability to translate problem-solving thoughts into code. There were no syntax errors simply because there was no attempt to solve the problem, which does not demonstrate any coding skill.",

  communication: {
    score: 3,
    suggestion:
      "There is no evidence of communication from the candidate regarding their thought process, approach to solving the problem, or any clarifying questions. The lack of any code or explanation suggests the candidate either did not understand the problem or chose not to communicate their thought process.",
