  question: `You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. 

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 

To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1: 
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3 
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6] 
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6]. The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2: 
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and []. The result of the merge is [1].


Example 3: 
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1]. The result of the merge is [1]. Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
